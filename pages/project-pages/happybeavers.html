        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Happy Beavers is a small business based in Helsinki, Finland, specializing in renting equipment for all
                kinds of parties and gatherings. Their offerings range from hot tubs and bouncy castles to wheel-of-
                fortune games and other essentials for a successful eventâ€”whether it's a child's birthday party or a
                bachelor party.</p>
            <p>At the time, an acquaintance of mine was working for the company and mentioned they were having
               issues with their website's user interface. I was happy to help.</p>    
        <h3>My Role:</h3>
            <p>Lead UI & UX Designer</p>
        <h3>Core Issues</h3>
            <ul class="list-style">
                <li>Outdated user interface</li>
                <li>Customers having difficulty placing orders</li>
                <li>Poor search engine rankings</li>
                <li>Lack of modern, expected website functionality</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <p>Figma, WordPress, and it's plugins like Elementor, Shopify, etc.</p>
        <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <p>It's hard to pinpoint just a few core problems, because, without throwing too much shade, the entire
                website was the problem. It had clearly been built by someone who was a developer first and a designer
                fifth. (See screenshots of the old website below.)</p>

            <p>Without saying, the only viable solution was a complete redesign.</p>
            <p>We were under a tight deadline, only about a month or two to design and build the site. Our team
               consisted of two people: one with no prior experience in UX/UI design, and one working pro bono
               (that's me) I had to take the lead of the project, which is something I've never done prior. To say the
               least, it wasn't the most promising start.</p>
            <p>Thankfully, we had a professional developer onboard, which meant we could focus entirely on design.
               However, we had little to no data to guide our design decisions, and no structured plan. Despite the
               constraints, we got to work.</p>   
            <p>Even though the business rents equipment for various types of events, children's parties are the most
               popular. With that in mind, we aimed to create a website that would appeal to parents: playful imagery,
               soft and cheerful colors, and simple, intuitive navigation.</p>   
            <p>The site also had to be built in WordPress using a custom theme provided by the developer. Since the
               staff lacked technical knowledge, the admin interface needed to be as foolproof and easy to update as
               possible.</p>   
            <p>One of the most critical challenges was fixing the broken ordering process. On the previous website,
               many customers had trouble placing orders, leading to frequent phone calls to staff for assistance. This
               was a massive design flaw, time-consuming for staff and frustrating for users. Worse yet, it likely drove
               away a significant number of potential customers who gave up and turned to competitors instead.</p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>One month after launch, the business saw a 30% increase in sales, with numbers continuing to rise
               compared to previous years. The new website also experienced increased traffic, and customer
               feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Importantly, support calls related to placing orders have
               significantly declined.</p>
            <p>All in all, this project was a major success, especially given the time constraints and limited resources.
