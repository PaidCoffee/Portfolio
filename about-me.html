                <h2>Nice to meet you, my name is Joonas</h2>
                <em><h3>I don't know how to do intoductions, I'm sorry.</h3></em>
                    <p>Born in Oulu, currently enjoying life in Espoo — for now.  
                    I’ve heard these “About Me” pages and portfolios are important,  
                    though I sometimes wonder how many people actually read them. Yet, here we are!</p>

                    <p>In 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Information Systems (BBA), and prior to that, I earned a Vocational Qualification in Business Information Technology.  
                    Since then, I’ve been exploring different jobs while desperately on the lookout for a full-time opportunity, in Finland or elsewhere.  
                    Most of my experience so far has been in marketing, UX, content creation, and communications. Even though I hold two degrees in tech-related fields, my ambitions and interests lie within the creative field.</p>

                    <p>Let’s get this out of the way first: I’m not a career person, and I probably never will be. I see work as something we all have to do because it makes our brains happy and puts bread on the table — that’s the extent of my relationship with work. That being said, I’m not only open to marketing positions (I also consider the fields I mentioned a few sentences ago to be part of marketing, since they kind of are), but I’m open to a wide range of work.</p>

                    <p>With my educational background in tech, creative hobbies, and some work experience in marketing, my skill set is incredibly flexible — so much so that it would be hard to start listing every single thing I can do. Hence, this website! I intend to display most of my work here, both professional and personal projects.</p>

                    <p>When I’m not working on the content of this website, you can usually find me at the gym or studying. I’ve been studying Japanese daily for almost six months now, and it has been a lifelong dream of mine to learn the language and live there one day. I’m also passionate about studying in general, and once work and life settle a bit, I plan on going back to school one more time. Coming from a working-class family, I’m already the most educated person in my family — so if anyone dares to go for a bachelor’s degree, I need to set the bar higher and crush their dreams!</p>

                    <p>Thanks for reading! If you’re interested in contacting me, you can download my resume below in either Finnish or English. You can also send me an email using the contact form or the email address found at the bottom of this site.</p>
