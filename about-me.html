            <h2>Who the fuck is this man?</h2>
            <h3>Seriously who is he?</h3>
            <p>Born in Oulu, currently hiding in Espoo — for now. 
               I’ve been told these “About Me” pages and portfolios are really important, 
               but I don’t believe anyone actually reads them. I certainly wouldn’t. 
               But here goes nothing.
            </p>

            <p>In 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Information Systems (BBA) 
                and have been doing odd jobs here and there, desperately looking for that mythical beast called a full-time job. 
                My professional life — saying that made me gag a bit — has mostly revolved around marketing.
                You might wonder, with my demeanor and educational background, why I decided to do marketing instead of working in tech. 
                Well, how the hell should I know, lmao. I’ve always seen marketing as the ultimate “I have no fucking clue what I’m doing with my life” career choice, 
                so at the time, it made perfect sense. Not that I’ve now unlocked some deep insight into my life’s purpose, 
                far from it, but at least I know marketing ain’t it.
            </p>

            <p>These days I’m trying to weasel my way into the tech sphere, preferably doing UI & UX design, 
                   IT support, or maybe coding if I can summon the willpower to keep my skills up-to-date.
                   Now that all that garbage is out of the way, let’s talk about something fun. 
                   When I’m not dooming about the pathetic state of the job market, 
                   you’ll probably find me drawing, gaming, lifting, reading, doing photography, or studying. 
                   Right now, I’m doing my best to invest most of my time in my projects, like this website, learning to draw, and learning Japanese. 
                   I’ve been thinking about going back to school at some point (preferably sooner rather than later). Have I decided what to study? Not yet. 
                   But I’m starting to get some clue about what I might want to do next.
                   If, for whatever reason, you made it to the bottom of this monologue, you can find my resume through the download button below. 
                   I’m not on any socials, so the only place you can stalk me is right here, on this website, which I might update once in a while. Bye.
