        <h2>Who's this guy?</h2>
            <p>
            Hi, I’m a tech-educated creative with a background in Business Information Systems and a passion for all things visual, verbal, and user-focused. While my education is rooted in technology, my career interests lean strongly toward the creative side — especially marketing, UX, content creation, and communications.
            I’m not chasing titles or climbing ladders; I simply want to do meaningful work that keeps my brain active and puts bread on the table. With a flexible skill set shaped by both studies and hands-on experience, I’m open to a variety of roles, especially those that value creativity, clarity, and curiosity.

        <h2>UX & UI</h2>
            <p>
                When I started my studies in BBA we were supposed to be trained as front-end developers, but I soon realized that I don't particularly enjoy coding but enjoyed
                the process of creating visually pleaseant user interfaces, yet here I am coding this website, oh well. I've been doing UX & UI-design ever since on occasion 
                and it's something that I could see myself doing full-time if the opportunity ever arises. 
                So, here you can find some of my projects that I feel are the most presentable. Here's just a portion of the projects that I've made during the 
                years but I'll keep adding to it when I feel like it.

        <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>
                Learning photography used to be one of my life-long dreams but during the past years 
                I've gotten a bit bored with the hobby due to other hobbies being more important to me nowadays. 
                Here you can find a fraction of photos that I've made during past three years and occasional new ones when I feel like busting out my camera.

                Another one of my life-long dreams that only took me 26 years of gathering enough courage to start doing. 
                For now this page is going to be an empty one, but one day I'll start posting here.

                Here you can read about my about my miscellaneous endeavours. As I'm coding this website I'll make a prediction that the blog page
                is going to end up being the most active page on this entire website, and I'm not backing down.
