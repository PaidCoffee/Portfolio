        <h1>Welcome To My Portfolio</h1>
            <p>
            Hi, I'm a tech-educated creative with a background in Business Information Systems and a passion for all things visual, verbal, and user-focused. While my education is rooted in technology, my career interests lean strongly toward the creative side — especially marketing, UX, content creation, and communications.
            I'm not chasing titles or climbing ladders; I simply want to do meaningful work that keeps my brain active and puts bread on the table. With a flexible skill set shaped by both studies and hands-on experience, I’m open to a variety of roles, especially those that value creativity, clarity, and curiosity.

        <h2>Webdesign Projects</h2>
            <p>
                When I started my studies in BBA we were supposed to be trained as front-end developers, but I soon realized that I don't particularly enjoy coding but enjoyed
                the process of creating visually pleaseant user interfaces, yet here I am coding this website, oh well. I've been doing UX & UI-design ever since on occasion 
                and it's something that I could see myself doing full-time if the opportunity ever arises. 
                So, here you can find some of my projects that I feel are the most presentable. Here's just a portion of the projects that I've made during the 
                years but I'll keep adding to it when I feel like it.

        <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>
                Learning photography used to be one of my life-long dreams but during the past years 
                I've gotten a bit bored with the hobby due to other hobbies being more important to me nowadays. 
                Here you can find a fraction of photos that I've made during past three years and occasional new ones when I feel like busting out my camera.
